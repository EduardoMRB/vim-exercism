# vim-exercism

Adds one simple mapping - `<Leader>t` - to run tests for the current exercise.

You must be in the exercise directory for this to work, but the mapping will work from either the test file or you exercise file.

The plugin relies on you exercises being stored in a directory named `exercism`.. which I'm assuming most if not all people's are.

Languages supported so far:

* Ruby
* Haskell
* Clojure
